Latex formats that have been useful to me


To change from long to short journal names I use bibstuff. 

      ./build/scripts-2.7/jabbrev.py ~/Dropbox/Papers/PhdBib1.bib examples/journal_abbreviations.txt > ~/Dropbox/Papers/PhdBib1-short.bib

Note - currently jabbrev skips articles that contain an "@" - need to be sure to eliminate those first. !

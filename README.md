===========

Latex stylings (for main text or bibliography) that have been useful to me.

* Molecular Ecology  (used for http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04561.x/abstract). Build with merlin.mbs. 
* `mine.bst` and `mine-unsrt.bst`   - derived from Mol Ecol. 

No guarantees or anything

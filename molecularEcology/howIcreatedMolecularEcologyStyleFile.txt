=== Molecular ecology stylesheet ===
1. The custom-bib package (with natbib activated) is extremely useful. Ran something like <code>latex merlin.mbx maybe?</code> and answered lots of questions to end up with a .dbj file. That can be edited by hand with help of the manual (very important!).
then <code>latex molEcol.dbj</code> creates the <code>molEcol.bst</code> file.

2. In the bst file, modified
 <code>
FUNCTION {bbl.etal}
{ "\bbletal{}"}
 </code>
to
 <code>
FUNCTION {bbl.etal}
{ "\bbletal{}."}
 </code>

3. Use that bst file for your bibliography.

4. Latex preamble requires natbib and <code>\setcitestyle{citesep={;},aysep={}}</code>
